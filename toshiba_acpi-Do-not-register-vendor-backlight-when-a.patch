Subject: [PATCH] toshiba_acpi: Do not register vendor backlight when
 acpi_video bl is available

commit a39f46df33c6 ("toshiba_acpi: Fix regression caused by backlight extra
check code") causes the backlight to no longer work on the Toshiba Z30,
reverting that commit fixes this but restores the original issue fixed
by that commit.

Looking at the toshiba_acpi backlight code for a fix for this I noticed that
the toshiba code is the only code under platform/x86 which unconditionally
registers a vendor acpi backlight interface, without checking for acpi_video
backlight support first.

This commit adds the necessary checks bringing toshiba_acpi in line with the
other drivers, and fixing the Z30 regression without needing to revert the
commit causing it.

Chances are that there will be some Toshiba models which have a non working
acpi-video implementation while the toshiba vendor backlight interface does
work, this commit adds an empty dmi_id table where such systems can be added,
this is identical to how other drivers handle such systems.
