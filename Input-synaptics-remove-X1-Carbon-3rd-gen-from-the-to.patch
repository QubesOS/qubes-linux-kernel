Subject: [PATCH] Input: synaptics - remove X1 Carbon 3rd gen from the
 topbuttonpad list

Lenovo decided to switch back to physical buttons for the trackstick on
their latest series. The PNPId list was provided before they reverted back
to physical buttons, so it contains the new models too.  We can know from
the touchpad capabilities that the touchpad has physical buttons, so
removing the ids from the list is not mandatory. It is still nicer to
remove the wrong ids, so start by removing the X1 Carbon 3rd gen, with the
PNPId of LEN0048.
